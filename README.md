This is a React-based client application that interacts with a backend API to process and filter data. Users can input JSON-formatted data, send it to a server, and display the response based on chosen filter options like Alphabets, Numbers, and Highest Alphabet.

- Built with React, Axios, and react-select
- Connects to a live backend hosted on Heroku
- Ideal for showing API interaction, data filtering, and simple JSON parsing
